This package contains functions to explore 2013-2015 data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS). 
This package was written for the Week 4 final assignment for the "Building R Packages" course on Coursera, as part of the Johns Hopkins University "Mastering Software Development in R" specialization.

The Data

The data in this package comes from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data. 
It lists data describing  fatal vehicle crashes in the United States 
An example of part of the 2013 data file is shown below:

fars_2013_fn <- make_filename(2013)
fars_2013 <- fars_read(fars_2013_fn) 
dim(fars_2013)
fars_2013

(For detailed information about the data, see the NHTSA FARS Manuals & Documentation page)

Loading FARS Data to your R workspace
Use the make_filename() and fars_read() functions, as shown in the previous section. 

Single Year
To look at single year data, use the fars_read_years() function with a single year as input. 
The only data columns selected are MONTH and year. This returns a list of length one, and the first element in the list is the tbl_df (the tidyverse data frame) listing the month and year for each fatal accident. By itself, this data is relatively meaningless unless you want to count number of fatalities by month.

fars_2014 <- fars_read_years(years = 2014)
fars_2014[[1]]

Multiple Years
To see fatalities for multiple years, enter a vector of years as the argument for the fars_read_years() function (examples: fars_read_years(years = c(2013, 2015)) or fars_read_years(2013:2015). 
This returns a list of tbl_dfs, with each elementshowing month and year for each fatality.

fars_3yrs <- fars_read_years(years = 2013:2015)
fars_3yrs

Summarizing FARS Data
The fars_summarize_years() function summarises up the number of fatalities by month and year

fars_summary <- fars_summarize_years(2013:2015)
fars_summary

Mapping Fatal Crashes
The fars_map_state function takes state ID number and a year, and maps that state's fatalities with a dot at the fatality location. 
For this you will probably need to load the mapdata package.

NB: An index of the state ID numbers is located on page 26 of the FARS Analytical User's Guide (2015).
